"""Simple decision rules — covers item 1.2 of the official assignment.

Wraps the rule-based logic ("if energy < 50 → reduce consumption") in the
exact shape requested in the syllabus. Distinct from `allocation.py`,
which runs a richer 4-stage load-shedding policy: this module is the
human-facing, didactic layer.

Inputs are snapshots (plain dicts), so the module has no dependency on
the simulator runtime — it can be evaluated against any data source.
