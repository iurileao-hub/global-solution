"""Simulator orchestrator: 1 step + complete horizon (Fase 3, M2).

Builds on M1's deterministic core. M2 adds the consolidation layers:
  * a battery-driven power_factor that throttles consumption targets, composed
    with the 4-stage load shedding (two-layer control, §3.3);
  * stochastic equipment failure with timed auto-repair (§3.6);
  * an OLS energy trend (slope + predicted next delta) and the CRITICAL→SURPLUS
    energy level it feeds (§3.5), recorded each step as output labels.

Determinism per seed is preserved: all randomness still flows through the
single injected RandomLCG, and run_simulation() resets per-module runtime
state so a fresh seeded run never inherits a previous run's failures or modes.
