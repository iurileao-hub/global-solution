"""Manual linear regression — covers item 1.3 of the official assignment.

Implements y = a*x + b with the closed-form OLS estimator, by hand:

    a = Σ((x - x̄)(y - ȳ)) / Σ((x - x̄)²)
    b = ȳ - a*x̄

No numpy / sklearn — only `sum()`, `len()` and a `for` loop, as required
by the assignment.

Specialized to the colony: trains over `history["wind_ms"]` vs
`history["wind_generation_kw"]` and predicts wind power for any future
wind forecast.
