Walks the criticality tree and sets each module's current_mode based on
available supply. Generators stay 'adequate' (own consumption is small,
generation is physics-defined, not policy-driven).

Stage 1: try everyone at 'adequate'; if it fits, distribute surplus.
Stage 2: downgrade Expansion → Sustenance → Vital to 'minimum', bottom-up.
Stage 3: shut Expansion → Sustenance off (Vital never).
Stage 4: emergency — critical alert (battery reserve handled outside
